# Square Shooter

This game is based on the NES classic Duck Hunt. 
In this game, however, the aim is to shoot the evil square out of the air to save the world. Because alien squares want to take over the world and only you can stop them!
Unfortunately, you don't have much ammunition and the square is getting faster and faster. How far can you make it?
So get ready, pick up your mouse and aim for the high score!


The game was developed as part of the HWR (Hochschule fï¿½r Wirtschaft und Recht) C++ course.

## How to play

1. Extract the windows_x64.zip
